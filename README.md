📌 Project Overview

This Tableau project analyzes Chicago crime data from 2019 to the present, uncovering trends, hotspots, and enforcement patterns across the city. By visualizing crime categories, time distributions, and geographic hotspots, the dashboards reveal how data-driven insights can support smarter policing strategies, policy planning, and community safety initiatives.

🎯 Objectives

Track crime trends over time (yearly, monthly, daily).

Identify high-crime neighborhoods and districts through geospatial mapping.

Break down crime categories (theft, assault, narcotics, burglary, etc.).

Analyze time-of-day and seasonal patterns of criminal activity.

Explore arrest rates and domestic incidents across different crime types.
